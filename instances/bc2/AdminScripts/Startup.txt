# This script file is run automatically when the server is launched.
# It contains commands on the same format as you would type them in the command console.
# It is always processed as if it is run by a logged-in user.
# It is run even if the remote-admin interface is disabled.
#
# When editing this file, you can check that it is syntactically correct by performing 'admin.runScript Startup.txt' from
#  the command console, and check the result.
#
#
# This is a good place to put one-time configurations of the server's gamemode (friendly fire on/off etc).
#
#
# Example:
#
#vars.hardCore true
#vars.friendlyFire true
#
#Default server settings.
